	--------------->Packet Switching[messages divided into fixed sized, #'d packets*3]
notes:
	1: DSL=digital line subscriber:converts to analog, audio freq used to repersent binary (0,1), one 			freq for 1, another for 0, then converted back again to data. MAX 64kb/s (uses copper)	
	2: Cable Modem=pooled resources 128kb/s uploads/download speeds audio/video clips
	3: disassembled/reassembled=packet switching
	4: if a route is blocked or down, it may use another path(incoming packets)
	5: this note is at this level[open systems[a system kept private by a commercial vendor]

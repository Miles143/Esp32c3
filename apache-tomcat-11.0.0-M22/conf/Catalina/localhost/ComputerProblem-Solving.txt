// Computer Problem-Solving //



Notes:
	In the Problem-Solving process, there are three phases: the algorithm
development phase(Analyze, Propose algorithm, Test algorithm), the implementation 
phase(Code, Test), and the maintenance phase(Use, Maintain). The output from the 
algorithm development phase is a plan for a solution. The output from the implementation
phase is a working pc program that implements the algorithm, the actual solution to the 
problem. the maintenance phase has zero outputs unless there is an error, if you the solution
is sent back to the first phase.

// Following an Algorithm //



Notes:
	To be an algorithm the steps must solve a problem.

// Developing an Algorithm //



Notes:
	Top-down design(functional decomposition), and Object-Oriented design.
Top-down design starts by breaking the problem into a set of subproblems, then 
each problem is divided into subproblems, directly creating a hierarchical structure,
a tree structure of problems and subproblems called modules. Modules can call on services
of modules at lower levels. One module for example could read data values, another could
sum data values, and another could print data values, while comparing overall entire sums.
A module that needs to be expanded is called an abstract step. A step that does not need to
be expanded is called a concrete step. In This example the levels of this particular forest
is as follows the "Levels 0-12". Also relate is file titled ObjectOrientation-Relationships_between_Classes.txt

Notes:
	Information: raw facts, and data is information organized for a pc to use.
	An information system can be defined as a software that helps organize and
	analyze data. Electronic spreadsheets and database management systems are
	two tools used to analyze data.

	A spreadsheet is a software app that uses, analyzes data using a grid
	structured of labeled cells, a cell can contain data, formulas, in text
	numbers, or "special" data such as dates. Spreadsheet cells are referenced
	by their row and column designation, by using letters to specify the column
	and numbers to to specify the row.(ex: A1, C7, G45, after the 26th column,
	spreadsheets begin to use two letters for column designation, so some cells
	have designations such as ex: AA19, with usually a maximum number of rows at
	appx 256, the rows 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. can be renumbered inside the grid to display
	a graph, so vertically 1-5 would be the number of weeks, and horizontally you
	would see Hal, Amy, Frank Total Avg, digitally the rows and cells stay the same
	visually you now would reference Hal at 1 weeks tutored 12 persons ect, 
	Note:
		the user has the control of preferences to change the font, size,
		color of the text to rerepersent the graph, row, cells and alignment
		as they choose, when creating a a spreadsheep and you want to sum some
		numbers the cell must absolutely must being with '=', also look for 'ƒx'
		in the banner and this can insert formulas. Spreadsheets are also good 
		for 'whatif' analysis.

		formula ex:
				example of a formula loop: 
						circular reference that cannot be resolved
//							CELL			CONTENTS		//
//							A1			=B7*COUNT(F8..K8)	//
//							B7			=A14+SUM(E40..E50)	//
//							E45			=G18+G19-D13		//
//							D13			=D12/A1			//


		In the title/Indentifier section: this is a perfect section for a key, this is used
//		for different types of identifiers and can substitute as a subsection for a		//
//		value, but must be unique, this means the numbers can be radically different, and do	//
		no have to be consecutive. The Structured Query Language (SQL) is a database language
		for managing rational databases, The original database was Sequal, developed by IBM in
		the 1970's(In 1986 American National Standards Institute[ANSI] published the SQL standard,
		the basis for commercial database language for accessing relational databases. SQL is not
		case-sensitive, whitespace counts.		
		
		Database Design:
				ex:
					enitity-relationship (ER) modeling captures the important record
		types,  attributes, and relationships in a grphical form, also defines the necessary schema
		to create the appropriate tables. Cardinality constraint puts restrictions on the number of 
		relationships that may exist. Cardinality constraints: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.
